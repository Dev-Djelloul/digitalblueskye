      "headerTitle": "RIDING CITIES PROJECT",
      "objective": "The objective of this project was to create a simple and informative website for a skateboarding association. It was about putting into practice my first knowledge of HTML and CSS, while respecting a mockup provided by the client.",
      "technologiesDetail": "For this project, I used HTML5 to structure the page content and CSS3 for styling and layout. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.",
      "challengesSolutions": "The main challenge was to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I learned to use media queries and relative units to ensure the site remains usable and aesthetic on all devices."

    "booki": {
      "title": "Booki - YellowBlueSkye Portfolio",
      "headerTitle": "BOOKI PROJECT",

    "ohmyfood": {
      "title": "Ohmyfood - YellowBlueSkye Portfolio",
      "headerTitle": "OHMYFOOD PROJECT",
      "objective": "The objective of this project was to develop a \"mobile first\" site that lists gourmet restaurant menus. The site had to allow online reservation and the composition of personalized menus, with a smooth user experience and refined CSS animations.",
      "technologiesDetail": "I used HTML5 to structure the content and CSS3 with Sass for styling and animations. The \"mobile first\" approach guided all development, with progressive adaptation for larger screens. The Sass preprocessor allowed me to organize my CSS code into reusable modules and simplify the creation of complex animations.",
      "challengesSolutions": "The main challenge was to create smooth and attractive animations to enhance the user experience. I implemented transitions on restaurant cards, loading animations, and hover effects on buttons. Another challenge was ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices. To solve these issues, I used modern CSS properties with vendor prefixes and extensive testing."
    },
    "printIt": {
      "title": "Print It - YellowBlueSkye Portfolio",
      "headerTitle": "PRINT IT PROJECT",
      "objective": "The objective of this project was to make a static web page more dynamic with JavaScript by adding an interactive image carousel. This project marks my first steps in JavaScript development, implementing simple but effective user interactions.",

    "sophieBluel": {
      "title": "Sophie Bluel - YellowBlueSkye Portfolio",
      "headerTitle": "SOPHIE BLUEL PROJECT",
      "objective": "The objective of this project was to create a dynamic portfolio website for an interior architect. The site had to allow users to view the architect's work, and administrators to log in to manage projects (add, modify, delete) via a secure administration interface.",
      "technologiesDetail": "This project was developed using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript for the front-end. I used the Fetch API to communicate with the existing backend (REST API), and implemented authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). I also used NPM to manage project dependencies, particularly for running the backend server.",
      "challengesSolutions": "The main challenge was to implement a secure administration interface allowing complete project management (CRUD). To solve this problem, I created a login system with JWT token storage, and developed an intuitive editing modal for adding and deleting projects. I also set up a category filtering system that dynamically updates the display of projects without page reload."

      "technologiesDetail": "This project was built using HTML5, CSS3 for the layout and styling of the cards and game board, and JavaScript for all the interactive functionality. I implemented event handling for card flipping, match validation, and game state management.",
      "challengesSolutions": "The main challenge was creating a smooth card-flipping animation and managing the game state throughout the session. I solved this by using CSS transitions for the animations and building a robust state management system in JavaScript to track flipped cards, matches, and game progress."
    },
    "arcadiaZoo": {
      "title": "Arcadia Zoo - YellowBlueSkye Portfolio",
      "headerTitle": "ARCADIA ZOO PROJECT",
      "objective": "The objective of this project was to create a complete zoo management application, allowing visitors to view information about animals and events, and administrators to manage all data (animals, enclosures, employees, events). This project was meant to demonstrate my full-stack development skills with various technologies.",
      "technologiesDetail": "For the front-end, I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap for responsive design, and JavaScript for interactions. On the back-end, I worked with PHP and its dependency manager Composer for the main server logic, MySQL for the relational database, Node.js and MongoDB for specific functionalities. The entire project was deployed on Heroku for easy online access.",
      "challengesSolutions": "The main challenge was integrating multiple database technologies (MySQL and MongoDB) within a single application. I solved this by creating a clear architecture that defines the responsibilities of each technology: MySQL for structured data (animals, employees) and MongoDB for more flexible data (events, comments). Another challenge was setting up a secure authentication system with different access levels, which I implemented using PHP with sessions and JWT tokens."

This project aimed to demonstrate my skills with React.js and modern front-end development principles.",
      "technologiesDetail": "I developed this application using React.js for component structure and user interface management. I implemented state management using React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) to efficiently manage application data. For data persistence, I used localStorage so users could maintain their information between sessions. I also created interactive data visualizations to graphically represent expenses.",
      "challengesSolutions": "The main challenge was designing an effective component architecture and properly managing the application state as it grew more complex. I solved this by using React's Context API to centralize state management and avoid prop drilling. Another challenge was ensuring a smooth user experience with appropriate transitions and animations while maintaining good performance. I optimized renders with techniques such as component memoization and judicious use of the useCallback hook."
    },
    "tetrisWindsurf": {
      "title": "Tetris Windsurf - YellowBlueSkye Portfolio",
      "headerTitle": "TETRIS WINDSURF PROJECT",

      "technologiesDetail": "This project was developed using vanilla JavaScript for game logic and interactions, HTML5 Canvas for graphical rendering of game elements, and CSS3 for user interface styling. I also implemented WebGL for certain advanced visual effects like water particles and light reflections. The responsive design allows for an optimal experience on all devices, from smartphones to wide screens.",
      "challengesSolutions": "The main challenge was adapting Tetris' classic game mechanics to a windsurfing theme while maintaining fluid and intuitive gameplay. I solved this problem by designing custom Tetris pieces that resemble windsurfing elements and adding visual effects such as waves and water splashes to enhance the nautical atmosphere. Another challenge was optimizing performance for mobile devices, which I solved by implementing efficient rendering techniques and adapting graphical complexity based on device capabilities."
